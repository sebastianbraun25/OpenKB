"""Wiki compilation pipeline for OpenKB.

Pipeline leveraging LLM prompt caching:
  Step 1: Build base context A (schema + document content).
  Step 2: A → generate summary.
  Step 3: A + summary → concepts plan (create/update/related).
  Step 4: Concurrent LLM calls (A cached) → generate new + rewrite updated concepts.
  Step 5: Code adds cross-ref links to related concepts, updates index.

Anthropic prompt caching is enabled via ``cache_control`` markers at two
breakpoints: end of the document message (caches system + doc across all
N+M+2 calls) and end of the assistant summary message (caches the additional
summary prefix across N+M concept-generation calls). Providers that do not
support cache_control receive a normalized list-of-blocks content payload,
which LiteLLM passes through cleanly.

_CONCEPTS_PLAN_USER = """\
Based on the summary above, decide how to update the wiki's CONCEPT pages and
ENTITY pages.

A CONCEPT is an abstract, recurring idea/pattern/mechanism (e.g. "agentic
systems"). An ENTITY is a specific named thing — a person, organization,
place, product, named work, or event (e.g. "Anthropic"). Each name goes in
exactly ONE group. A topic may have both (entity "NVIDIA" and concept
"ai-infrastructure-demand"); they cross-link, they do not merge.

Existing concept pages:
{concept_briefs}

Existing entity pages (with source counts = how many docs already cite them):
{entity_briefs}

Return a JSON object with two top-level keys, "concepts" and "entities".

"concepts" is an object with:
1. "create" — new concepts. Array of {{"name": "concept-slug", "title": "Title"}}
2. "update" — existing concepts with significant new info. Same shape.
3. "related" — existing concept slugs to cross-link only. Array of strings.

"entities" is an object with the same three keys, but create/update objects
add a "type" field, one of: __ENTITY_TYPES__. Example:
   {{"name": "anthropic", "title": "Anthropic", "type": "organization"}}

Rules:
- Most of your proposals should be "update" or "related" against the
  existing pages listed above — reuse and cross-link what's already there
  rather than fragmenting knowledge into new pages. Only propose "create" for
  a topic that clearly doesn't fit anything existing yet.
- __DOC_TOKEN_GUIDANCE__
- Concept and entity names must be short and general — at most 3 words.
  Never use a unique identifier, hash, or ticket/case number as a name, and
  avoid overly specific combinations (e.g. a person's name plus their role in
  this one case, or a technology plus one specific incident path). If a
  candidate doesn't reduce to a short, general, reusable phrase, do not
  propose it.
- Create an ENTITY page only when the entity is (a) central to this document
  or (b) likely to recur across sources. Do NOT page proper nouns mentioned
  only in passing.
- Prefer "update" over "create" for any concept or entity already listed above.
- Do NOT create a concept/entity that overlaps an existing one — use "update".
- Do NOT create concepts that are just the document topic itself.
- "related" is lightweight cross-linking only, no content rewrite.

    Uses ``_CONCEPTS_PLAN_USER`` to get a plan with create/update/related
    actions, then executes each action type accordingly. Concept bodies are
    generated in memory, scrubbed of unresolved wikilinks, and only then
    written to disk. When ``rewrite_summary=True`` (short-doc path), the
    summary is rewritten by the LLM after concepts are finalized so its
    wikilinks reflect the actual concept pages on disk.

    ``insert_mode`` (see ``openkb.config.resolve_insert_mode``) controls what
    happens when one or more planned concept/entity updates cannot be
    generated:

    - ``"normal"`` (default): unchanged behavior — failures are logged as
      warnings and whatever *did* generate is written; the document as a
      whole is still considered compiled.
    - ``"fail-fast"``: the first concept/entity generation failure cancels
      every other still-pending (not yet started) generation in this batch
      and immediately raises ``ConceptCompilationError`` — nothing from this
      batch is written.
    - ``"fail-at-end"``: every planned concept/entity generation is attempted
      (so every failure for this document is logged in one pass) and
      whatever succeeded is written, same as "normal" — but
      ``ConceptCompilationError`` is raised at the end if anything failed.

    In both strict modes the raised exception is expected to propagate out of
    ``compile_short_doc``/``compile_long_doc`` so the caller's existing
    mutation rollback discards this add entirely (see
    ``ConceptCompilationError``).

    ``concept_update_mode`` (see ``openkb.config.resolve_concept_update_mode``)
    controls how EXISTING concept/entity pages absorb this document: the
    default ``"rewrite"`` sends the full page back to the LLM for a rewrite;
    ``"append"`` generates a short note instead (the LLM never sees the
    existing page) and appends it via ``openkb.agent.compiler_notes`` — no
    LLM call for the write itself. New pages are generated the same way in
